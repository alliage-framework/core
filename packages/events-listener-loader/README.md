# Alliage Events Listener Loader

Provides a way to create events listener in an Alliage application without having to create a module

## Dependencies

- [@alliage/di](../dependency-injection)
- [@alliage/lifecycle](../lifecycle)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @alliage/events-listener-loader
```

With npm

```bash
npm install @alliage/events-listener-loader
```

## Registration

If you have already installed [@alliage/module-installer](../module-installer) you just have to run the following command:

```bash
$(npm bin)/alliage-scripts install @alliage/events-listener-manager
```

Otherwise, update your `alliage-modules.json` file to add this at the bottom:

```js
{
  // ... other modules
  "@alliage/events-listener-loader": {
    "module": "@alliage/events-listener-loader",
    "deps": [
      "@alliage/di",
      "@alliage/lifecycle",
      "@alliage/service-loader"
    ],
    "envs": [],
  }
}
```

## Usage

All we need to do to create an events listener is to create class extending the `AbstractEventsListener` and to register it as a service as we can see below:

```js
import { AbstractEventsListener } from '@alliage/events-listener-loader';
import { RUN_EVENTS } from '@alliage/lifecycle';
import { Service } from '@alliage/service-loader';

class MyEventsListener extends AbstractEventsListener {
  getEventHandlers() {
    return {
      [RUN_EVENTS.PRE_RUN]: this.handlePreRun,
      [RUN_EVENTS.POST_RUN]: this.handlePostRun,
    };
  }

  handlePreRun() {
    process.stdout.write('Test pre run\n');
  }

  handlePostRun() {
    process.stdout.write('Test post run\n');
  }
}

export default Service('my_events_listener')(MyEventsListener);
```

As we can see in the previous example, all we need to implement the `getEventHandlers` method which must return an object whose key are the events we want to handle and the value are the functions called when an event occurs.

### Restrictions

As the load of the events listeners happens during the initialization phase it's not possible to listen to any event happening duting the initialization phase.
