# Alliage Service Loader

Automatic import and registration of services.

## Dependencies

- [@alliage/di](../dependency-injection)
- [@alliage/lifecycle](../lifecycle)
- [@alliage/module-installer](../module-installer)
- [@alliage/config-loader](../configuration-loader)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @alliage/service-loader
```

With npm

```bash
npm install @alliage/service-loader
```

## Registration

If you have already installed [@alliage/module-installer](../module-installer) you just have to run the following command:

```bash
$(npm bin)/alliage-scripts install @alliage/service-loader
```

Otherwise, update your `alliage-modules.json` file to add this at the bottom:

```js
{
  // ... other modules
  "@alliage/service-loader": {
    "module": "@alliage/service-loader",
    "deps": [
      "@alliage/lifecycle",
      "@alliage/di",
      "@alliage/module-installer",
      "@alliage/config-loader"
    ],
    "envs": [],
  }
}
```

## Usage

The goal of this module is to allow us to import and register services without having to create an alliage module.

### Configuration

Once installed, a new file located in `config/services.yaml` should be available that should look like this.

```yaml
basePath: 'src'
paths: ['services/**/*']
exclude: ['services/**/NotAService.*']
```

- The `basePath` parameters just tells the module where is located the source code of our application.
- The `paths` parameters will define which files must be considered as services and thus must be automatically imported and registered.
- The `exclude` parameter will allow to exclude files that could match one of the `paths`.

### Define a service

To define a service, the module must follow the following rules:

- Its path must match with what's configured in the `config/services.yaml` file
- It must export the service as `default`
- It must declare the service using the `Service` decorator

Like in the following example:

```js
import { Service } from '@alliage/service-loader';
import { service, parameter } from '@alliage/di';

class MyService {
  constructor(otherService, dummyParameter) {
    super();
    this.otherService = otherService;
    this.dummyParameter = dummyParameter;
  }

  // ...
}

export default Service('my_service', [
  service('other_service'),
  parameter('parameters.dummy_parameter'),
])(MyService);
```

The `Service` decorator takes following parameters:

- The service's name (which must be unique)
- The list of dependencies

Once done, the service will be automatically loaded !

## Events

### Service loader events

```js
import { SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS } from '@alliage/service-loader';
```

| Type                               | Event object                                                | Description                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.BEFORE_ALL` | [ServiceLoaderBeforeAllEvent](#serviceloaderbeforeallevent) | Before loading all services      |
| `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.BEFORE_ONE` | [ServiceLoaderBeforeOneEvent](#serviceloaderbeforeoneevent) | Before loading one service       |
| `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.AFTER_ONE`  | [ServiceLoaderAfterOneEvent](#serviceloaderafteroneevent)   | After having loaded on service   |
| `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.AFTER_ALL`  | [ServiceLoaderAfterAllEvent](#serviceloaderafterallevent)   | After having loaded all services |

#### ServiceLoaderBeforeAllEvent

This is the instance of the event object received in any `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.BEFORE_ALL` listener.

- `getBasePath(): string`: Returns the base path as configured in the configuration file
- `getPaths(): string[]`: Returns the paths as configured in the configuration file
- `getExclude(): string[]`: Returns the exclusions as configured in the configuration file
- `setPaths(paths: string[]): ServiceLoaderBeforeAllEvent`: Allows to re-define the paths
- `setExclude(exclude: string[]): ServiceLoaderBeforeAllEvent`: Allows to re-define the exclusions

#### ServiceLoaderBeforeOneEvent

This is the instance of the event object received in any `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.BEFORE_ONE` listener.

- `getModulePath(): string`: Returns the path of the service about to be loaded
- `getName(): string`: Returns the unique name of the service about to be loaded
- `getConstructor(): string`: Returns the constructor of the service about to be loaded
- `getDependencies(): Dependency[]`: Returns the list of dependencies of the service about to be loaded
- `setConstructor(constructor: any): ServiceLoaderBeforeOneEvent`: Allows to re-define the constructor of the service about to be loaded
- `setDependencies(dependencies: Dependency[]): ServiceLoaderBeforeOneEvent`: Allows to re-define the dependencies of the service about to be loaded

#### ServiceLoaderAfterOneEvent

This is the instance of the event object received in any `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.AFTER_ONE` listener.

- `getModulePath(): string`: Returns the path of the loaded service
- `getName(): string`: Returns the unique name of the loaded service
- `getConstructor(): string`: Returns the constructor of the loaded service
- `getDependencies(): Dependency[]`: Returns the list of dependencies of the loaded service

#### ServiceLoaderAfterAllEvent

This is the instance of the event object received in any `SERVICE_LOADER_EVENTS.AFTER_ALL` listener.

- `getBasePath(): string`: Returns the base path as configured in the configuration file
- `getPaths(): string[]`: Returns the paths as configured in the configuration file
- `getExclude(): string[]`: Returns the exclusions as configured in the configuration file
